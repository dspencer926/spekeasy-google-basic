# Speakeasy

1. Choose language you'll be speaking in (on the left) and language you want to translate to (on the right)
2. Click the microphone button to record your voice.  The colors on the mic should respond to the audio input, so if there's no color change on the mic button, that means the app isn't receiving any audio input from your mic.
3. Click the mic button again when you're done speaking and app will do the rest :)
